## Justifications for the two APIs chosen
The APIs chosen (1. Art Institute of Chicago, 2. xxx) fit the criteria stipulated by the MVP. Some alternatives were considered but rejected due to not meeting MVP requirements and/or involve work beyond the MVP. For example,
- MoMA, US (The Museum of Modern Art, New York) - cannot return multiple ids per API request.
- Science Museum, UK - return multiple types of media (objects of art, people, animal/plant specimens, terminologies, etc.).
- Smithsonian Institute, US - requires API key, thereby will involve some backend.
